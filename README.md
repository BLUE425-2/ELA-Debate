Mao Zedong's goals were to transform China into a communist power and become a more recognizable nation, and Deng Xiaoping aimed for China to be rich and powerful. Mao successfully achieved his goal of becoming a communist nation but after establishing the Great Leap Forward campaign China fell into struggle. Afterwards, Deng wanted to help China by launching powerful market forces, attracting foreign investors and improving China's economy. Both Mao and Deng ended up leaving China with struggle, and they both lasted a communist state except Mao ended with a failing economy and Deng ended in industrial and agrarian decay. Along with that, during Mao's control the cultural revolution began almost leading China into a civil war, but Deng had the Tiananmen uprising instead.
